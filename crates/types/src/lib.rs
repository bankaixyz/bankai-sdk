//! # Bankai Types
//!
//! Shared type definitions for the Bankai SDK ecosystem.
//!
//! This crate provides common types used across the Bankai SDK, verification library,
//! and API. It's designed to work in both `std` and `no_std` environments, making it
//! suitable for use in constrained environments like smart contracts and ZK circuits.
//!
//! ## Modules
//!
//! - [`proofs`] - Core proof types (MMR proofs, hashing functions) - works in `no_std`
//! - [`api`] - API request/response types (requires `std` and `api` feature)
//! - [`utils`] - Utility functions (MMR operations)
//! - [`block`] - Bankai block representations with beacon and execution client data
//! - [`fetch`] - Types for proof fetching and wrapping (requires `verifier-types` feature)
//! - [`verify`] - Types for verification results (requires `verifier-types` feature)
//!
//! ## Feature Flags
//!
//! - `std` (default) - Enable standard library support
//! - `api` - Enable API types (requires `std`)
//! - `verifier-types` - Enable verifier-specific types (fetch/verify modules)
//! - `serde` - Enable serde serialization support
//! - `utoipa` - Enable OpenAPI schema generation
